# Portfolio_Tracker_Task

Portfolio_Tacker is a simple web-based application that i developed as a part of task submission. It showcases my knowledge and skills I gained during my training in Full Stack Development.

I designed these applications to provide features to users like Add/Update, Edit, Delete as part of the task dashboard session it include 2 visuals like Total stock value, and Top Stock it compares all the stock that added in the portfolio and give the top stock.

#Technologies:

I used the Spring Suite platform to execute the code and add some dependencies like Started-Web, SpringFramework.boot and also Spring_boot_started_data_jpa.
-->FrontEnd-HTML,CSS,JavaScript
-->Databse-Oracle
-->Java,SpringBoot(Tomcat Server with port 8082 number) 
with the help of GET,PUT,DELETE connects the frontend to backend..

steps to execute the code:
1..Run the code in spring suite by adding the required dependencies.
2..By running the application with spring boot app(we start the request with http://localhost:8082/index.html which shows the webpage...and that data is added to the database by using the API stock requests..
