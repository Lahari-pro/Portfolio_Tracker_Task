# Portfolio_Tracker_Task

Portfolio_Tacker is a simple web-based application that i developed as a part of task submission. It showcases my knowledge and skills I gained during my training in Full Stack Development.

I designed these applications to provide features to users like Add/Update, Edit, Delete as part of the task dashboard session it include 2 visuals like Total stock value, and Top Stock it compares all the stock that added in the portfolio and give the top stock.
